It seems like there's a bit of disorganization and some unclear content. Let me help you tidy it up.

The text appears to be a mixture of a thank you message, some unclear symbols, and a mathematical equation. Here's a possible reorganization:

"Thank you!"

It seems like there might be a question, but it's not entirely clear. The symbols "~", "+", and "=" are often used in mathematical contexts, but without more information, it's difficult to provide a specific answer.

Could you please provide more context or clarify what you're trying to ask or communicate? I'm here to help!
