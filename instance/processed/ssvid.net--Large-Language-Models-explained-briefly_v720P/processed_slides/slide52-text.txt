It appears to be a jumbled collection of letters and words. Here's a possible organization and correction:

* "ol e" could be "ole" or possibly "old" or "ole" as in a chemical term, but without context, it's hard to determine.
* "S s e" could be "SSE" which is an abbreviation for various things, or it might be "see" or "sea" with an extra "s".
* "Dot i 4" seems to be a mix of letters and numbers. It's possible that it's meant to be "dot i4" or "dot i 4" which could be a reference to a specific item or code, but without more information, it's unclear.
* "frytorier" seems to be a misspelling of the word "fritter" or possibly "fryer" or "fryery" but the closest match is "fryer" as in a device for frying food, or "fritter" as in a type of food.

If you could provide more context or information about what these words and letters are supposed to be, I'd be happy to try and help you further.
