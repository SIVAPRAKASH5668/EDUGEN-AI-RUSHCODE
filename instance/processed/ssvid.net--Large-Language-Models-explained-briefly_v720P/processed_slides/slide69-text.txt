It appears that there are several mathematical equations listed. Here are the corrected and organized equations:

1. 622.796 × 9,184.649 = 5,720,161.532
2. 932.719 × 8,400.912 = 7,835,687.399 (Note: The "%" symbol is likely a typo and should be replaced with "×" for multiplication)
3. 6,118.971 + 8,280.633 = 14,399.604
4. 439.109 × 3,252.044 = 1,428,311.119 (Note: The result 7,932,088.129 seems incorrect based on the given numbers)
5. (No equation provided, just the number 647)
6. 4,721.427 + 1,007.012 = 5,728.439
7. 3,161.967 × 6,404.234 = 20,249,976.586
8. 9,666.064 + 4,770.098 = 14,436.162

Please let me know if you need further clarification or if there's anything else I can help with.
