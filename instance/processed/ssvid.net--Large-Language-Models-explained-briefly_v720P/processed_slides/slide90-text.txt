It appears that the text you provided is a jumbled mix of words and characters. To organize and correct the content, I will attempt to separate the coherent text from the random characters.

The coherent text appears to be a passage from a literary work, possibly "A Tale of Two Cities" by Charles Dickens. Here is the corrected text:

"Monsieur Gabelle came down, bringing his life with him for that while. Within a hundred miles, and in the light of other fires, there"

The random characters, such as "OOCOKMOO", "aQBOOORR", "DROMOOOO", "@O HO O AR A", "REOMCAEOO", and "MOOOOORO", do not appear to be part of the original text and can be ignored. If you have any further information or context about the text, I may be able to provide more assistance.
