It appears that the text is a jumbled collection of famous phrases and quotes. Here's a corrected and organized version:

1. "To be or not to be, that is the question." - This is a quote from William Shakespeare's play Hamlet.

2. The phrase "somehow" seems to be missing, but the sentence "The gym seemed like a good idea until I realized" could be a coherent thought.

3. "Feeling the burn" is a common phrase used to describe the sensation of muscle fatigue during exercise. The phrase "fancy way of saying" could be completed as "it's a fancy way of saying it hurts."

4. E=mc² is Einstein's famous equation relating energy (E) and mass (m) with the speed of light (c).

5. The quote "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times" is from Charles Dickens' novel A Tale of Two Cities.

6. The phrase "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously" is a famous example sentence coined by Noam Chomsky to demonstrate the difference between syntax and semantics in language. It is grammatically correct but semantically nonsensical.

Here's the rewritten text in a more coherent and organized form:

The famous phrase "to be or not to be, that is the question" from Hamlet came to mind. Somehow, the gym seemed like a good idea until I realized that "feeling the burn" is just a fancy way of saying it hurts. On a different note, E=mc² is Einstein's famous equation relating energy and mass. In literature, "it was the best of times, it was the worst of times" is a iconic quote from A Tale of Two Cities. Meanwhile, linguists often cite the phrase "colorless green ideas sleep furiously" as an example of a sentence that is grammatically correct but semantically nonsensical.
