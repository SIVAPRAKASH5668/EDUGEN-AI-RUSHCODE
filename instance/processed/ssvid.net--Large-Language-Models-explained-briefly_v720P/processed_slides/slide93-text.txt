It appears to be a comparison of computational power and time. Here's a reorganized and corrected version:

1 Billion computations per second

= 1,000,000,000 computations/second

To put this into perspective:

* Performing 1 billion computations per second would take:
	+ Approximately 100 years to complete 3.15 quintillion (3,155,760,000,000,000,000) computations.
	+ Approximately 100,000,000 years to complete 3.15 sextillion (3,155,760,000,000,000,000,000) computations.

Please note that these calculations are estimates and are based on the assumption that the computations are being performed at a constant rate of 1 billion per second.
