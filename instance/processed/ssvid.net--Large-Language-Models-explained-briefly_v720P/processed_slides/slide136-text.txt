It seems like you're trying to start a story. Let's organize and correct the content:

The story begins with the setting: "Down by the river." This establishes the location where the story will take place, likely on the river bank. 

To continue the story, you could add more details about the setting, introduce characters, or start the plot. For example:

Down by the river, the sun was setting behind the trees, casting a warm orange glow over the water. The river bank was quiet, except for the occasional bird chirping or fish jumping out of the river. It was a peaceful scene, perfect for the start of an adventure.

Please feel free to add more to the story, and I'll be happy to help!
