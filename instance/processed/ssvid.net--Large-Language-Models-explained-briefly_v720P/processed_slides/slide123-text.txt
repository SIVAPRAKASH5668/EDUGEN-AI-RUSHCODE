It seems like there's a coded message or equation here. The equation "MEEEEEE=D" doesn't make sense in a traditional mathematical or linguistic context. However, if we consider "M" as a variable representing a number and "E" as a variable representing a number as well, we could interpret this in different ways, but without additional context, it's difficult to provide a specific solution or meaning.

If you're referring to something specific, like a game, puzzle, or a particular subject, please provide more context so I can offer a more accurate and helpful response.
