It appears that there are several mathematical operations listed, but they are not organized or formatted correctly. Here are the corrected calculations:

1. Multiplication:
   - 9,184.649 × 622.796 = 5,720,161.532
   - 8,400.912 × 932.719 = 7,835,687.399
   - 3,252.044 × 2,439.109 = 7,932,088.129
   - 6,404.234 × 3,161.967 = 20,249,976.586

2. Addition:
   - 6,118.971 + 8,281.414 = 14,399.604 (corrected the number 8,28 to 8,281.414, assuming it was a typo)
   - 4,721.427 + 1,007.012 = 5,728.439
   - 9,666.064 + 4,770.098 = 14,436.162 (corrected the result to 14,436.162, assuming it was a calculation error)

Note: The phrase "1 Billion computations per Second" seems unrelated to the mathematical operations listed. If you could provide more context, I'd be happy to help further.
