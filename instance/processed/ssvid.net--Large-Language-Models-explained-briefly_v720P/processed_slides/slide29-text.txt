Here's a rewritten version of the text, organized into coherent paragraphs:

William Shakespeare is widely regarded as one of the greatest writers in the English language. However, on some mornings, getting out of bed can be a challenge. It's a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done, but the process of waking up can be chaotic. I try to get out of bed, but end up knocking things over, including my glass of water, and somehow managing to unplug my phone charger in the process.

The gym seemed like a great idea, but "feeling the burn" is just a euphemism for pain. When I'm trying to work out, I often find myself wondering when the next "Harlem Shake" meeting is, or contemplating complex concepts like Schrödinger's cat, who is both alive and dead until observed. It's a strange mix of physical activity and abstract thought.

As I go about my day, I'm reminded of the famous quote from Charles Dickens' novel "A Tale of Two Cities": "it was the best of times, it was the worst of times." This phrase seems to capture the essence of my morning routine, which can be both productive and chaotic. Finally, the phrase "Colorless green ideas sleep" comes to mind, a famous example of a sentence that is grammatically correct but semantically nonsensical. It's a reminder that language can be both beautiful and absurd.
