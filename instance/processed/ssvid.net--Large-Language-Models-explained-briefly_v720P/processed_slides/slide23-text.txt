It appears that there are multiple texts mixed together. Here's a reorganization and correction of the content:

**The Pythagorean Theorem**
The Pythagorean theorem states that a² + b² = c² for right triangles.

**Historical References**
Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation. (This is a quote from the Gettysburg Address by Abraham Lincoln.)

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. (This is a quote from the novel "A Tale of Two Cities" by Charles Dickens.)

**Literary Quotes**
We beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past. (This is a quote from the novel "The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald.)

I am no bird; and no net ensnares me: I am a free human being with an independent will. (This is a quote from the novel "Jane Eyre" by Charlotte Brontë.)

**Personal Anecdotes**
I told my boss I had a doctor's appointment, but really I tried to start a garden. Apparently, plants need more maintenance than I thought.

**Art and History**
Vincent van Gogh is known for his post-impressionist paintings. The Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardo da Vinci, is one of the most famous works of art in the world.

**Science and Architecture**
The theory of relativity, proposed by Albert Einstein, revolutionized our understanding of space and time. The Colosseum in Rome is an ancient amphitheater that could hold up to 50,000-80,000 spectators.

Note: I corrected some errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation to improve the clarity and coherence of the text.
