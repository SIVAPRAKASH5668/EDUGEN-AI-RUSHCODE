It appears that the text you provided is a jumbled collection of words, numbers, and symbols. To organize and correct the content, I will attempt to separate the narrative from the numerical values and symbols.

The narrative seems to start with the phrase "Down by the river bank ... until they jumped into the." This suggests a story or scene involving a river. Some of the words that follow, such as "water," "river," "lake," "grass," "waves," "shallows," "pool," "depths," and "mist," support this idea.

Here's a possible reorganization of the narrative:

Down by the river bank ... until they jumped into the water. The river flowed into a lake, surrounded by grass and waves. The shallows were home to various creatures, and the depths were a mystery. A pool of calm water reflected the surrounding scenery, while the mist rose from the surface.

As for the numerical values and symbols, they appear to be unrelated to the narrative. Some of the numbers seem to be grouped together, while others are paired with symbols like "+" and "-". Without further context, it's difficult to determine the significance of these values.

Here are the numerical values and symbols, grouped and separated from the narrative:

1. 18, 23, 102, 477, 130, 07, -85, 64
2. 03, +39, 42, -12, 12, +70, 16
3. 42, +61, -75, -65, +99, +36, 10, +58, +98
4. 61, 77, 31, 1, +99, -7, 09, +49, 14

The remaining symbols, such as "%", "|", and "I3%", appear to be unrelated to the narrative or numerical values. Without further context, it's difficult to determine their significance.

If you could provide more information or clarify the intended meaning of the text, I may be able to assist you further.
