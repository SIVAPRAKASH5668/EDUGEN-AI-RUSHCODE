It seems like you're starting to quote a song. The lyrics are: 

"Down by the river, on the bank of the river..." but I think I can complete it for you: 

"Down by the river, on the bank of the river, lay a dead dog. Down by the river, on the bank of the river, lay a dead dog."

However, I think a more common and well-known completion would be from the song by Neil Young: 

"Down by the river, I shot my baby. Down by the river, I shot my baby."
