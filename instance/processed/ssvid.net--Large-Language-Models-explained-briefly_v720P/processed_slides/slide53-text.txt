It seems like the text is jumbled and needs to be organized and corrected. However, without more context, it's challenging to provide a precise correction. 

If we attempt to decipher the given text, it appears to be a mixture of letters and symbols. Here's a possible organization of the content:

"Pos
BO
egs
gsy g - EREEE. L - e
= ZEE EEEE g
— . — B
s S e, -
s . s - EmEE - z
- BT el ="

However, this still doesn't form a coherent message. Could you please provide more context or clarify what the original text is supposed to be? I'll do my best to assist you in correcting and organizing it.
