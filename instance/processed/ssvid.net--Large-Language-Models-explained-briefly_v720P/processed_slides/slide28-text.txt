It seems like there's been a jumbled mix of quotes and phrases. Let's try to organize and correct the content:

1. The phrase "It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done" appears to be a quote from Charles Dickens' novel "A Tale of Two Cities." The complete quote is: "It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to, than I have ever known."

2. The sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a well-known pangram, a phrase that uses all the letters of the alphabet at least once. It seems like parts of this phrase were scattered throughout the text.

3. The phrase "with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye" appears to be a quote from Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry's novel "The Little Prince."

4. The mention of "parkour" and "feeling the burn" suggests a discussion about exercise or physical activity.

5. The phrase "to be, or not to be, that is the question" is a famous quote from William Shakespeare's play "Hamlet."

6. The reference to "6,650 kilometers" and "walking around in his skin" seems to be a mix of unrelated ideas.

7. The mention of "Harlem Shake" appears to be a reference to the viral dance challenge.

It's difficult to provide a clear and coherent text from the given content, as it seems to be a collection of unrelated quotes and phrases. If you could provide more context or clarify what you're trying to communicate, I'd be happy to help you organize and correct the content.
