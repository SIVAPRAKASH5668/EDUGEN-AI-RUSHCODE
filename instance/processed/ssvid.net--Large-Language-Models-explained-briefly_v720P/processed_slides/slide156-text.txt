Here's a possible establishment of a setting for the beginning of a story:

The sun was setting over the serene river bank, casting a warm orange glow over the lush green grass and towering trees that lined the water's edge. A gentle breeze rustled the leaves, causing the branches to sway softly in the fading light. The sound of the river flowing gently over smooth rocks and around bends filled the air, creating a sense of peace and tranquility. As the stars began to twinkle in the night sky, the river bank transformed into a magical and enchanting place, perfect for the start of an unforgettable journey.
