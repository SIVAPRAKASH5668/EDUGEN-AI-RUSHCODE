It seems like the content is jumbled and needs to be organized and corrected. Here's my attempt to rearrange the words:

"Doll Baby" or possibly "Doll B" is not clear, but I'll provide a few options.
 
1. "Dol B" could be "Doll B" or "Dolby" 
2. "[ e Pank]" seems to be "Pink" or possibly a name, "Pank" 
3. "unil" is likely "until"
4. "fthey" appears to be "they"
5. "A.ytention" seems to be "Attention"

If I had to create a sentence using these words, it would be:
"Doll B or Dolby, until they get my attention, possibly wearing something pink."
