It seems like you're listing different time frames. Here's a possible organization and correction of the content:

**Time Frames:**

1. **1 Year**: A unit of time equivalent to 365 days (except for leap years, which have 366 days).
2. **100 Years**: A century, which is a period of 100 years.
3. **10,000 Years**: A period of 10,000 years, which is often used to describe a significant span of time in history, geology, or archaeology.
