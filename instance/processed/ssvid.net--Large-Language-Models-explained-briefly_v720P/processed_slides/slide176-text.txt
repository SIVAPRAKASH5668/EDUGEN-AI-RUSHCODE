It seems like the text is a bit jumbled. Let me help organize and correct it.

The corrected text would be:

"Where do facts live?"

Or, if you'd like to include the mention of LLM (which stands for Large Language Model), it could be:

"Where do facts live? Inside an LLM."

Please let me know if you have any further requests or questions!
