It appears that you're trying to convey a comparison between computational power and time. Here's a reorganized and corrected version:

= 1 billion computations per second =
= 1 billion computations per second =

To put this into perspective:

* 1 billion computations per second
* S (presumably representing a single second)
* 100,000,000 years (representing a vast amount of time)

If we assume that the comparison is between the number of computations per second and the number of years, we could rephrase it as:

Performing 1 billion computations per second, it would take approximately 100,000,000 years to complete a certain task (although the specific task is not mentioned).
