It seems like the text is jumbled and requires decoding. Let's try to unscramble it:

1. OHOHRRIBRP -> HORIZON BRIP (no clear decoding, possibly "HORROR" or "HORRIBLY" with some letters missing)
2. AOMRIAEOHO -> MARIA HOEO (no clear decoding, possibly "MARIO" with some letters missing)
3. DO OAIOME -> DO I AMOE (no clear decoding, possibly "DO I AM" or "DO ME A")
4. MO AROOO -> MOOR AO (no clear decoding, possibly "MOO" or "MOOR")
5. MHDBAOHMAO -> (no clear decoding, possibly "HOMEBODY" or "BODY" with some letters missing)
6. HOROHIOMOHM -> (no clear decoding, possibly "HORROR" or "HOMEMOHM" with some letters missing)

The signature "â€” negligencsy" seems to be a play on the word "negligence" with a typo or intentional misspelling.

Without more context, it's difficult to provide a clear decoding of the text. If you can provide more information or clarify what you're trying to accomplish, I'd be happy to help further.
