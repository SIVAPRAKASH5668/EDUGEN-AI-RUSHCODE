It seems like the text is a jumbled collection of words and phrases. Here's a possible organization and correction of the content:

* Worst: 26%
* Worse: 12%
* Age: 12%
* Best: 10%
* End: 8%
* Very: 8%
* Blur: 8%

The phrase "3Pp most Jo" is unclear, and "t wa s the best" appears to be a sentence fragment. If you could provide more context or information, I'd be happy to try and help you further.
