**User:** How and when was the internet invented?

**AT Amistat:** The internet was created in the late 1960s as a project by the United States Department of Defense. It was initially called ARPANET and was created as a way for computers to communicate with each other for military purposes. In the 1970s and 1980s, the internet began to expand and evolve, eventually becoming the global network we know today.
