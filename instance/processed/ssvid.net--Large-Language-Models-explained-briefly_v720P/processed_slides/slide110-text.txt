It appears that the text is jumbled and unclear. Here's a possible reorganization and correction:

"Picture 0.96
Doll & Me"

Or, alternatively:

"Picture 0.96
Dole & MEE"

Without more context, it's difficult to determine the intended meaning. If you could provide more information or clarify what you're trying to communicate, I'd be happy to try and assist further.
