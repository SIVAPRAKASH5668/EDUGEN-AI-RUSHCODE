It appears that the provided text is disorganized and contains errors. Here's a corrected and organized version:

"Dowd" and "By e" seem to be incomplete phrases or sentences. Without more context, it's difficult to provide a clear correction. However, I can suggest a possible reorganization:

* The text "0.79" appears to be a numerical value, but its relevance is unclear.
* The phrase "Dowd By e" could be a name or a phrase, but it's incomplete.
* The symbol "[[[" is likely an error or a placeholder.
* The phrase "y| [jumped" seems to be a sentence fragment.
* The word "Attention" appears to be a heading or a call to attention, but its connection to the rest of the text is unclear.

If you could provide more context or clarify the intended meaning, I'll be happy to help you further.
