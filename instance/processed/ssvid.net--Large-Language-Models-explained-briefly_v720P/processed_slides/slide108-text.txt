It seems like there's a jumbled mix of characters and words. To organize and correct the content, I'll try to make sense of it.

The text appears to be "Rl ™ B @ Ea" followed by "Attention". 

A possible correction could be "Real Boy at EA" or "Role ™ B at EA", but without more context, it's difficult to provide a definitive correction. 

If you could provide more information or clarify what you're trying to communicate, I'd be happy to help further.
