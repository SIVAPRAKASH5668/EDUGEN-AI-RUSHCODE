It appears to be a jumbled collection of words and phrases. Here's a possible reorganization and correction:

* "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times." (This is a famous quote from Charles Dickens' novel "A Tale of Two Cities.")
* "Best" and "worst" are antonyms, with "best" meaning the most excellent or superior, and "worst" meaning the most inferior or unpleasant.
* "Most" is an adjective used to describe something that is the greatest in amount or degree.
* "End" can refer to the conclusion or termination of something.
* The phrases "[ 1%]" and "| 0%" appear to be fragments of statistical or mathematical expressions, but without context, it's difficult to provide a clear interpretation.

If you could provide more context or clarify what you're trying to communicate, I'd be happy to try and assist you further.
