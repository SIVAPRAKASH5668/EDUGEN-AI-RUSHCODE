It appears that the text is jumbled and contains typos. Here's a possible correction and organization of the content:

"Oh, I see. The big wee ghost. 
George was, Neath, set on fire and burned. 
So where is the exit?"

Or, if you'd like to reorganize it into a more coherent passage:

"Oh, I see. George, a big wee ghost, was set on fire and burned near Neath. So, where is the exit?"
