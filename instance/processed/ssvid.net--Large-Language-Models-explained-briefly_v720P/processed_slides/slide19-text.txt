Here's the organized and corrected content:

I had a bit of a disastrous day. I set off the smoke alarm, traumatized my dog, and ate a new form of food that I hadn't tried before.

At 3 AM, I was stopped by an officer who asked me why I was climbing the McDonald's sign, which was part of the entrance arch for the World's Fair in Paris.

I explained that my GPS had told me to turn right, so I did, but unfortunately, I ended up driving into a lake. In my defense, the GPS didn't specify that I should be on a road when making that turn.

I'm also having a bit of a social media crisis. Someone I was stalking (I mean, casually observing) liked a photo I posted, and now I'm feeling a bit anxious. If I hear one more person say "it's just the humidity" when I complain about the weather, I'm going to lose it.

On a separate note, my friend asked me to be honest about her new haircut, and I have to say, it's not my favorite. I'm now looking for a new friend and a good place to hide until her hair grows back. I've never felt so personally attacked by a piece of technology in my life.

Oh, and to make matters worse, the clocks sprang forward an hour in April, and I'm still trying to adjust to the new time. I'm striking thirteen, and it's not a good feeling.
