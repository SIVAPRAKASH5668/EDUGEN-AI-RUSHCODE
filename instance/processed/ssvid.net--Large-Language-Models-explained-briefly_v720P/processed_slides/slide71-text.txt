To organize and correct the content, let's break it down:

1. **1 Billion computations per Second**: This is a rate of computation, meaning a device or system can perform 1 billion calculations or operations in one second.

2. **Conversions**:
   - **1 Second** = 1 second
   - **1 Minute** = 60 seconds
   - To find out how many computations are done in a minute, we multiply the number of computations per second by the number of seconds in a minute.
   - **Computations per Minute** = 1,000,000,000 computations/second * 60 seconds = 60,000,000,000 computations/minute

So, in one minute, a system that can perform 1 billion computations per second would perform 60 billion computations.
