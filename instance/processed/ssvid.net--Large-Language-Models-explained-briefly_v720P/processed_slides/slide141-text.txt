It seems like you have a mix of text and unrelated characters. Let's organize and correct the content.

Here's the corrected version:

Down by the river bank.

This phrase is:
- Establishing a setting
- The beginning of a story
- Referring to a location: River bank

The other characters (`]; i 7 4 A7) i 3|`) appear to be random and unrelated to the text. If you could provide more context or information about what these characters represent, I'd be happy to help further.
