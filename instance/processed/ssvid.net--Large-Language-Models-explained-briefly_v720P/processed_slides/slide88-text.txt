It appears that the given text is a mix of a literary quote and a jumbled collection of letters. Here's the organized and corrected content:

The literary quote seems to be from Charles Dickens' "A Tale of Two Cities". The corrected quote is:

"So kind," urged Miss Manette, 
"as to leave us here. You see 
how composed he has become, 
and you cannot be afraid to"

The rest of the text appears to be a jumbled collection of letters, possibly a cipher or a random arrangement of characters. Without more context, it's difficult to decipher the meaning or purpose of these letters. If you could provide more information or clarify the intended use of these letters, I'd be happy to try and assist you further.
