It appears that the text is disorganized and contains some unclear characters. Here's a possible correction and organization of the content:

Picture 0.75 - A
Picture 0.52 - Down by the mill, by pleasure.

Or, it could be:
Picture 0.75 - A
Picture 0.52 - Down by the mill, with pleasure.

Please note that without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact meaning or intended organization of the text. If you have any further information or clarification, I'd be happy to try and assist you further.
