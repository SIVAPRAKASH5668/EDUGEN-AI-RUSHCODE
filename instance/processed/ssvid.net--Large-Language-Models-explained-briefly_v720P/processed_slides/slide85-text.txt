It appears you have listed two time periods:

1. 10,000 years
2. 1,000,000 years

These time periods are often used to express large scales of time, such as geological or historical events. To put them into perspective:

- 10,000 years is roughly the timeframe since the end of the last Ice Age, marking the beginning of the current geological epoch, the Holocene.
- 1,000,000 years (or 1 million years) is a much larger scale, often used in discussions about evolutionary biology, paleontology, and geological processes that occur over extremely long periods.
