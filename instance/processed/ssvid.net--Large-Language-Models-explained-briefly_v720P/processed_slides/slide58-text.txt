It appears that the text is a jumbled and encoded message. Here's a possible correction and organization:

"5 = 

Five little Indians

One little, two little, three little, four little, five little Indians"

This correction assumes that the original message was referencing the traditional children's song "Ten Little Indians" and that the encoded text was attempting to convey the title and a portion of the lyrics.
