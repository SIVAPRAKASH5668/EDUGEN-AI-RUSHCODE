Here is the organized and corrected content:

1. The Eiffel Tower was built in 1889 as the entrance arch for the World's Fair in Paris.

2. In 1912, the Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg on its maiden voyage, just 30 minutes into what was supposed to be a three-hour tour.

3. Call me Ishmael. (This appears to be the opening line from the novel "Moby-Dick" by Herman Melville.)

4. My GPS told me to turn right, so I did, right into a lake. In my defense, it didn't specify that I should be on a road when making that turn.

5. The past is never not even past. (This quote appears to be from William Faulkner's novel "Requiem for a Nun".)

6. "Item in bagging area" - it yelled at me, and I've never felt so personally attacked by a piece of technology in my life.

7. I swear, if I hear one more person say "it's not the heat, it's the humidity," I'm going to lose it. 

8. It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. (This appears to be the opening line from George Orwell's novel "1984".)

9. This would be a good place to hide until my hair grows back. 

Note: The original text seemed to be a collection of unrelated quotes, jokes, and sentences. I've tried to correct the formatting, punctuation, and grammar to make it more readable. However, the content itself remains a mix of different topics and styles.
